Hello.
The Main difficulty for CBR is to extract data.
And there I can make a big difference.
Every case can be represented as an object (with linked objects).
Basically the case is a chain (state-actions-state-actions).
And the main difficulty in data extraction is to classify text (is that a state or a action text) - this is much easier than building a transformer that will extract objects from unstructured text.
And it's quite easy to extract data about those objects with a Q&A.

I plan to:
1) Build a generator of questions based on few-shot learning and neural net.
I want to specify objects, its properties, text and result object and get questions about any object properties.
2) Build a cases extraction system
(extractions of chains of actions-states)

That allow us to:
1) Get as many cases as possible Without training a giant transformer
2) Get outstanding quality of reasoning in the health system (we have well-known states, actions and results. And zero cases because of possible faults of neural nets)

Second part:
Union states and make graphs of states. To make assumptions about how health can change in further.
In short - we must simply find most related cases/states and look at what is a better strategy now.

I have specialization from coursera (machine learning) and 3 years experience as a programmer to build such systems.
