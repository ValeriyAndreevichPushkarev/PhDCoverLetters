Hello
I want to build an ideal pipeline for image reconstruction (with machine learning) that can work with different models, even electronic microscopes.
Here is a small plan of the ideal pipeline for optical imaging (even for the holographic microscope):
1) Filter all noises
2) Pretrain a quantized neural network (or SVM) to get "low-quality" images or data about objects for 2-3D microscopy.
3) Use that data for a more detailed solver based on global optimization.
4) Maybe add more fast solvers to get more data for a detailed solver (or reduce the possible solution space).
5) Write all of that as kernels for CUDA, OpenCL, or another high-level framework.

Or build a tool where you can add fast raw calculations and detailed calculations based on global optimization.

That concept looks like a bloom filter, where we can reduce the size of the solution space with some fast computations (based on a neural net or even SVM) and get detailed results for nanoscopy with a solver. (because it's not always fast to find global optimum (solution) for 200 frames with resolution 200x100. That is the main problem for direct solving method).

Here, we can simply build several types of models for different techniques.

What I already have (and why I am eligible):
1) Global optimization is better than multistart (2–3 times faster) (without basins of attractions and other suboptimal approaches). https://medium.com/@pushkarevvaleriyandreevich/gr​adient-descent-that-we-must-have-5a4542e218a0
2) Experience with Matlab (from the institute)
3) Experience with Python (courses from EdX or Coursera)
4) Specialization in AI from Stanford University (with distinction) and 2 related courses
5) Experience with GPU kernels


All of that allows me to develop algorithms to get images from electronic or nanomicroscopy in a fast and efficient way.
