Why do I want to change my field of education?
Well, I'm almost a God in statistics and relevant fields (you can read some publications/results).
(https://medium.com/@PushkarevValeriyAndreevich - Global optimization that works better than anything)
https://medium.com/@PushkarevValeriyAndreevich2 - statistical model better than in IBM)
And AI is coming to the world of programming (to destroy it). So bioengineering and related disciplines are quite connected with the field of production/medicine/other.
	
	What I plan to research 
VLP is quite an interesting theme (we now have a Nvidia Microbes and other complex and fast simulators to get immune response more efficiently).
But VLP is quite simple yet effective anyway. 
To produce more effective VLP I plan to reduce potential binding points of VPL (and improve quilty of antibodies a lot).

Even if I don't change the world with a significant results improvement, I can use my global optimization method and reduce the number of biological experiments a lot :).
	
	Why I can do that
Well, now almost all biology is machine learning and programming. And all basic concepts (binding, folding, variativity, etc) it's quite easy to understand.
