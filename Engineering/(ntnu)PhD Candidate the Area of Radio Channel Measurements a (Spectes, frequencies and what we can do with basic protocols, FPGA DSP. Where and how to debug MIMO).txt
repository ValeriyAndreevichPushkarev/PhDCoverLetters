Hello.

Every data sequence with almost any type of modulation (except amplitude modulation of cause) has a different spectral density.
That is obviously because they have different results after Fourier Transform :).

So we can determine signals that can reach much longer than other signals (because of spectre).
Also, we can simply build amplitude/phase characteristics of transmission function based on the quality of different sequences.
If that effect takes place we can develop a new protocol that can change the basis of binary codes to use them in transmission.
If not - we will get a good transmission function to work with.

The other part of work - determine weaknesses of MIMO solution.
1) So, we can simply get transmission functions for different weather conditions and frequencies and check main frequency/modulation types.
2) Check real spectral density of radio channel - there is can be a lot of surprises here
3) Check protocol (on all OSI levels) - there is can be a lot of errors that reduce quality of link

That is the brief description of planned work.
