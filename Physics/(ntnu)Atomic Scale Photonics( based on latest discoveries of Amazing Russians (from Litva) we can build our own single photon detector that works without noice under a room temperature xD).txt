Hello.
There are many theoretical materials about detection of single electrons withing near-cryogenic parameters.
But there is a large field that is almost undiscovered - quasi stationary states and what we can do with them.

Latest discovery - transistors with electrons on quasi stationary levels.
Basically - if we add a laser light to any surface, we will get another energy level of electrons (even without photoionisation).
With another light source we can even make an ionization event.

That led us to the new fast and robust transistors (IBM and Skolkovo(Russia), https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03866-​9)
And of course to the new light sources (that can be drived by another light source).

Theoretically, we can improve detector efficiency or get any other, unknown advantages from that (better LEDs)

That is what I want to research during my work.
Also, it's possible to build simple scripts to get leds, diodes based on that effect.
Ideal result - get single atom light sources and detectors.

Metamaterials - its a several more degree of freedom for building a light sources and a light detectors.
Its always possible to change some configuration of semiconductors in 3d to get some effect (because of physics)

And I have experience with machine learning.
At least I know that for any success in automatic discovery in that field we must specify:
1) grammatics (objects: p-zone, n-zone, insulators, light sources, etc). parameters of objects (size, material type, positions).
There we can add almost all possible actual trends in that field
2) The end states
what we want to get and how to score that.
(power consumption/quality of detection,
spectre,
efficiency,
how can we adjust parameters of electric field\light source and what we get (in terms of power/quality/&nbsp;spectre/efficiency)

3) Workflow:
Build a theory from grammatics (p-zone inside n- sone, two light sources).
Adjust parameters with Global optimization
Score results
Save results to DB

I have specialization in machine learning,
Nice articles with Global Optimization (rated by astrophysics):

So I can work under quite complex and big problems by myself.
Also I have 3 years as a programmer so I can do almost all needed machine learning (and programming) parts.
