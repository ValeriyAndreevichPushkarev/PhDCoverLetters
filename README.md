# PhDCoverLetters
Repo with PhD cover letters.

Every letter have an institute and brief description of methods and main technologies that planed to use in work.

If you find a error or incorrect plan of work - let me know.

If you disagree with something that written here - let me know.

## Favorite parts

DreamCoder as it described by author - bidirectional A*, persistent states and functions instead of lisp. And NLU/knowledge bases (yep, AGI :) )

Reading competition - Q&A and getting information about known objects (as it described in definition xD). There is no need for a 20b transformer here.

Protein work model - 5 segments to get the form of a central fragment.
Two nearest fragments with binded molecules, two farest without respect to binding (only type). There are many ions here. All can be delivered from a quantum chemistry simulator.

Atomic-scale light detector. Yes, there are quasi stationary states of electrons described by Scolkovo and IBM. So the energy of ionization can change (and several little tricks).

Myosin - make it smaller or bigger to get better muscles?

## Looks very funny, especially when you have:

[Best selector (after synthesis)](https://github.com/ValeriyAndreevichPushkarev/Selector_8bit)

[Best global optimization method (compared with standart from Matlab)](https://medium.com/@pushkarevvaleriyandreevich/gradient-descent-that-we-must-have-5a4542e218a0)

[Best IPC technology (with generator) (compared with existed ones in linux kernel) Part 1](https://medium.com/@pushkarevvaleriyandreevich/making-libs-drivers-verilog-endpoints-for-custom-hardware-for-windows-linux-f8cf2d1e8efe)

[Best IPC technology (with generator) (compared with existed ones in linux kernel) Part 2](https://medium.com/@pushkarevvaleriyandreevich/making-libs-drivers-verilog-enpoints-for-custom-hardware-for-windows-linux-8a6f580aa3f3)

And other [Not yet implemented projects with strong theoretical basis](https://github.com/ValeryAndreevichPushkarev)


Its kinda like a **overview of your portfolio of past projects**

**(can be PDF or website: [example 1](https://andykong.org), [example 2](https://www.rayanarmani.com))**.
