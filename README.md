# PhDCoverLetters
Repo with PhD cover letters.

Every letter have an institute and brief description of methods and main technologies that planed to use in work.

If you find a error or incorrect plan of work - let me know.

If you disagree with something that written here - let me know.

## Looks very funny, especially when you have:

[Best selector in the world (after synthesis)](https://github.com/ValeriyAndreevichPushkarev/Selector_8bit)

[Best global optimization method in the world (compared with standart from Matlab)](https://medium.com/@pushkarevvaleriyandreevich/gradient-descent-that-we-must-have-5a4542e218a0)

[Best IPC technology (with generator) (compared with existed ones in linux kernel) Part 1](https://medium.com/@pushkarevvaleriyandreevich/making-libs-drivers-verilog-endpoints-for-custom-hardware-for-windows-linux-f8cf2d1e8efe)

[Best IPC technology (with generator) (compared with existed ones in linux kernel) Part 2](https://medium.com/@pushkarevvaleriyandreevich/making-libs-drivers-verilog-enpoints-for-custom-hardware-for-windows-linux-8a6f580aa3f3)

And other [Not yet implemented projects with strong theoretical basis](https://github.com/ValeryAndreevichPushkarev)


Its kinda like a **overview of your portfolio of past projects**

**(can be PDF or website: [example 1](https://andykong.org), [example 2](https://www.rayanarmani.com))**.
